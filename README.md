# 2017-JupyterNotebooksForGeophysics
MSc Geophysics Seminar on developing Jupyter Notebooks for Geophysics 


## Scope
This course aims at discussing advanced computational methods in seismology, and other topics with the aim of developing skills to write and maintain Jupyter Notebooks for small projects and teaching. In addition we learn some basic tools for code development (github). 

## Format
Participating students will prepare basic theoretical concepts, simple python-based notebooks, and possibly report on some applications of methodologies in geosciences.
